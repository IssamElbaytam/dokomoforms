1. Encryption
  - Column-level encryption doesn't work for our needs at all...
  - Filesystem-level encryption looks best.
2. Behavior-driven/baby's first test-drive development
  - Want the application to conform to some behavior? Write a test stub!
  - E.g. want administrative information to be inaccesible to a regular user?
    - Here's a test stub...

    /tests/user_test.py:

    import unittest


    class TestUser(unittest.TestCase):
        def testRegularUserCannotSeeAdminInfo(self):
            assert False
